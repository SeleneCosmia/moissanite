## _Brainstorming:_

- Generally speaking, I want this project to be themed around _gemstones, astrology, mythology, <sub>etc..</sub>_ 
related things in general

<br>

> \[!NOTE\]
> This repo and its codebase, as it stands, is not functional in any capacity at the time of writing this README file -- it's _MOSTLY_ my playground for becoming familiar with both [raylib][3] and [crystal-lang][4]

<br>
<sup>Despite the project's name, nothing about it has yet been set in stone </sup>
